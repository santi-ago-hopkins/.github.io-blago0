This time of year is pretty strange, at least in Berkeley. I would say only 30% of students are back from winter break. This time of year, when you run into someone in Berk, the quintessential question is "what are you doing here?." It seems that there's not one standard reason for a student to return so early to school. 

I haven't really had many obligations this past week, but thought it best to get some meaningful R&R before I start work in Burlingame this coming Monday. I've had quite a lot of time to think, and have gained a new sense of gratefullness for all the people that have helped me out along the way. Thinking back, I find it hard to find a reason why people would help me out. I only expect someone to help me out if I can bring some value to them. 

#### my last semester

This is my last semester at Berkeley and it still feels as if I left a lot on the table. In retrospect, I was really taking a piss my first two years. A part of me is regretful that I didn't realize earlier what it took, but a part of me is also grateful that I had a pretty fun first two years. I particularly recall my second semester of my Freshman year...I was in 12 units and it was definitely ill-advised not to take more, but I met my girlfriend that semester, and the unstructuredness of our schedules felt unique and fleeting. 

I can't tell whether or not this is the semester to lock in or fuck around. Maybe I can do both. 

#### my favorite spots on campus

I think this ^^ will be the title of my next post, but I think one of the spots I hadn't really appreciated until recently is Edwards stadium, where I currently type this out :D :D
