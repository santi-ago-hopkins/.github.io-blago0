I'm currently on the train back home and thought it time I finally get to critical mass on this blog here. 

Thought a blog would be a cool soap box to have, and with my aging self, a hedge against early-onset dementia. I'm not too sure what my posting frequency will look like, but I'll try to stay consistent through this coming year.
