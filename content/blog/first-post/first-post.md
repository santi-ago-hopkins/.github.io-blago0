I was recently in Brownsville, TX for an onsite interview with SpaceX. It was a cool experience, but I ended up getting rejected a few days later. I was offered at this robotics company for a co-op for this coming Spring semester, and it is somewhat enticing. I'm taking this train ride to think through some of my options and priorities...

So this last semester after Zoox let me know they wouldn't return me I considered three main options: 
1. full-time position
A full-time position is the ultimate goal, but I'm not sure if this is achievable for my skillset and current market. I've had very low standards in terms of what I put stick my resume into. I'll apply to anything with a pulse with the exception of defense companies. If I do get a full-time position, the best case-scenario would be getting a full-time position I really enjoy in some large city. The worst would be getting a full-time position that I don't like and would then feel the need to recruit for other full-time positions.

2.  grad school
I seriously considered graduate school for the latter half of this past October. The concept of school seems so securr. What turned me away was 1) the cost 2) the realization that there's a non-trivial chance that I would be in the same position I'd be in a year from now.

3. internship/co-op
I seriously considered a co-op on two assumptions either 1) I don't have enough expereince to secure a solid full-time position or 2) the market isn't good enough for my skillset right now. I'm not sure which it is, but maybe the second option would be too wishful.

For this past semester, full-time recruitment fell through, grad school is not a viable option, and the internship option just seems mediocre. Keeping in mind that full-time employment is the ultimate goal, this leaves me with three options. 

1. Take the semester off, and co-op, graduate in 2026, also, look for full-time positions
2. Graduate on time, recruit for full-time positions full-time
3. Co-op, stay in school, and look-for full-time positions

The third option seems the most ideal, but I'm not sure how feasible it is to do all three, in this situation I would be prioritizing nothing. I'd play it safe and split the pot thrice. 

The second option would be nice. It would be great to enjoy my last semester in school with friends that wouldn't be around if I would return to finish in 2026. The worst case for this would be I can't secure a job, If I couldn't do that, I'd have to get some type of service job. This isn't the end of the world, but I'm not sure if I could support myself with low savings. Best case would be I secure a job early and can fuck off the rest of the semester.

The first option would be hell. I could do it, but I would have a tough semester and would do none of the responsibilities super well. This would lower my chances of securing a full-time position, but I'd be betting that this internship would either result in a RO or critical mass to break into industry. In this situation I'd be prioritizing my career in the long-run. On-paper this is the best option, but I feel like I'm sacrificing just a bit too much. I want to walk in May, but I could also enjoy weekends, and afternoons with my friends. There's nothing rational keeping me from this option.
